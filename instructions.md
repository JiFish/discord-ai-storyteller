# Game Instructions

Take part in a shared storytelling experience in this channel!

- Create a character like `!newcharacter name, race, class, pronouns, appearance`
- Join in at any time! You don't need to read the whole adventure to jump in.
- Anything you say in channel will be treated as instructions for what your character is doing.
- 2d6 will be rolled to give the GM an idea of how well your action went.
- You can't take two turns in a row.
- Your character can speak at any time using `!say` without prompting a response from the DM. e.g. `!say I agree with Jim.`
- If you want to send a message Storyteller doesn't hear, start your message with `(whisper)`, `#`, or `!whisper`. Anything you don't whisper WILL be sent to the DM!
- If you wish, you can `!leavetheparty`. Sorry to see you go...
